# Cathedral Escape

## Background

Cathedral Escape is a text-adventure game. The player takes control of an unnamed detective who is
investigating a mysterious murder at a medieval Cathedral. While he is investigating, he gets knocked out.
When he wakes up, he finds himself in what looks like a torture room with nothing but a small knife. The player
must then navigate this Cathedral fighting or escaping monsters that are everywhere. The player will find
items and equipment throughout the cathedral to help in their escape. Puzzles will also be scattered and
solving them will reward the player with items and equipment. The goal is to escape while refiguring
what is happening in the cathedral.
